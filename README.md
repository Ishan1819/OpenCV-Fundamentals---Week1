Setup

Create venv (optional):

python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac
source .venv/bin/activate


Install deps:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the code by:

cd <go inside the directory whose code to be run>
python <filename.py>

Research (Misc)

Image Processing Concepts ‚Äì quick take

Filtering: smooth noise or sharpen details.

Thresholding: separate foreground/background.

Transforms: rotate, scale, warp for alignment and effects.

Use cases: face blur in news, cleaning medical scans, document cleanup.

OpenCV Applications ‚Äì examples

Robotics: obstacle detection, path following.

Medical: MRI/X-ray analysis.

Autonomous: lane/pedestrian/car detection.

Surveillance: motion/people detection.

AR: overlay graphics on real world.

Inspection: defect detection on assembly line.

Docs: scan + crop + OCR.

Face ID: attendance, door access.

Gestures: control with hand signs.

Windows vs Linux ‚Äì OpenCV Windows

On Windows, GUI (imshow) should run in main thread. Else windows may freeze.

On Linux, a bit more forgiving, still better to keep GUI on main thread.

waitKey() is important to keep window responsive.

If GUI is missing, save images to file or use Matplotlib to display.

üóíÔ∏è Notes / Common Issues

If cv2.imshow fails on some Windows setups, save output to file or use Matplotlib to show.

Haar cascades are fast but may miss cases; deep models are better for accuracy.

When stitching fails, ensure 30‚Äì50% overlap and good texture.

OCR works better after grayscale + slight blur or threshold.
